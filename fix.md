## 🔄 Debug Process & Resolution
1. Initial Issues Identified:
   - Transcoder dependency error
   - MainActivity not found error
   - Gradle cache corruption

2. Step-by-Step Resolution:
   a. Cleaned Gradle Cache:
      - Removed problematic cache: `~/.gradle/caches`
      - Resolved transcoder dependency issues
   
   b. Package Name Mismatch:
      - Found MainActivity in wrong location: `com.example.reelai`
      - AndroidManifest expected: `com.reelai.reelai`
      - This mismatch caused `ClassNotFoundException`

   c. Fixed Directory Structure:
      - Created correct package path:
        ```
        android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/reelai/reelai/
        ```
      - Moved MainActivity.kt to correct location
      - Updated package declaration in MainActivity.kt
      - Removed old example package directory

3. Key Learnings:
   - Package names must match exactly between manifest and file structure
   - Android's package structure is physical (files must be in matching directories)
   - Gradle cache issues can mask underlying configuration problems

## 📋 Current Status
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ App launches correctly
- ✅ Package names aligned with Firebase configuration
- ✅ Proper Android project structure

## 🔍 Technical Details
1. File Locations:
   ```
   AndroidManifest.xml: android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
   MainActivity.kt: android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/reelai/reelai/MainActivity.kt
   ```

2. Package Structure:
   ```
   com.reelai.reelai
   └── MainActivity.kt
   ```

3. Critical Configurations:
   - Package name in manifest matches Kotlin package declaration
   - MainActivity extends FlutterActivity
   - All build tools versions aligned

## 📝 Future Recommendations
1. Maintain consistent package naming:
   - Keep `com.reelai.reelai` across all Android configurations
   - Ensure new Android files follow the same package structure

2. Version Control:
   - Consider adding package structure validation to CI/CD
   - Document package structure requirements

3. Build Process:
   - Regular Gradle cache cleaning when switching branches
   - Verify package structure before major version updates

## 🔄 Critical Build Configurations (from android/build.gradle)
1. Android Build Tools:
   - Kotlin version: 1.9.0
   - Gradle Plugin: 8.2.1
   - Google Services: 4.4.0

2. Previously Missing Files (Status):
   - [✅] android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties (fixed)
   - [✅] android/local.properties (configured correctly)

## 🚫 Current Known Issues
1. Transcoder Dependency Issue
   - Error: Missing jetified-transcoder-0.10.5/META-INF/com/android/build/gradle/aar-metadata.properties
   - Related to video_compress package
   - Possible causes:
     - Gradle cache corruption
     - Android build tools metadata issue
     - Package resolution problems

## 📝 Next Steps
1. Gradle Cache Resolution
   - [ ] Try complete Gradle cache clean
   - [ ] Rebuild with fresh dependencies
   - [ ] Monitor for metadata file generation

2. Build Verification
   - [ ] Verify all dependencies resolve correctly
   - [ ] Check for any conflicting transitive dependencies
   - [ ] Ensure Gradle daemon is running with correct configuration

## 📋 Notes
- All core environment requirements are now met
- Focus is on resolving package-specific build issues
- No version changes needed as current configuration should work
- System has adequate disk space after cleanup

## 🔄 Next Action
Clean Gradle cache completely and attempt fresh build to resolve transcoder metadata issue
